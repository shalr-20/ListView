# ListView

ListView is a UI component in Android that is used to display a vertically scrollable list of items. It is one of the earliest methods for showing lists in Android applications.

## Limitations of ListView

**1. Not Efficient:** ListView loads all the items at once, leading to performance issues with large datasets.

**2. RecyclerView is the Advanced Form:** RecyclerView is a more efficient alternative that reuses item views, improving memory and performance.

**3. Automatic Scrolling:** Unlike ScrollView, ListView scrolls automatically without additional configuration.

## Using an Adapter in ListView

- An Adapter is used to bind data to a ListView. 

- It fetches data from a source (such as a database, an ArrayList, or an array) and sets it onto the ListView.
